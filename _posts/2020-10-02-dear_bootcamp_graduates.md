## An open letter from the engineer playing HR person when they would rather be programming, because #startuplife

One of the joys of #startuplife is being able to put on different hats. One of my hats is HR person/bouncer guarding the door to the party.

The media always bangs on about something being the "new thing" in technology. For a while it was all about IoT (mostly home automation systems, but what we do at MicroSec is more exciting than that), BIG DATA!!!, $$cryptocurrency$$ (and cryptography). Now it's all about data science, machine learning and AI.

We have been looking to hire data scientists, so yours truly has doing most of the legwork. I've noticed a corresponding rise in the number of applications for this role, almost to the exclusion of the other roles we have available. 

Thanks to the pandemic-induced recession, there are many applicants who are very obviously recent career-changers. I hope that this is helpful for you. 

The main thing for you to keep in mind is that I will recommend hires who are the least risky to the company. We can take more of a chance when hiring interns - we do and have converted interns into permanent employees. I'm one of them. 

### What we look for
When hiring permanent employees and interns, we have a wishlist of experience in the following languages, tools and frameworks:
- embedded engineers: C/C++, embedded Linux, experiences with different chipsets and device applications
- full-stack developers: Python, Flask, Django, SQL databases (e.g. PostgreSQL),
- front-end developers: JavaScript (we use Angular), other things like d3.js, Vue
- data scientists: Python and its data analysis packages and tools and the ability to work with the full-stack developers to come up with an integrated product. So, some full-stack experience or understanding is ideal. If you want to work alone crunching and cleaning data and trying out different models in your Jupyter notebook, the company is not for you. 
- UI/UX: Designs for websites (for a desktop environment - think complicated dashboards) using Adobe and design tools of your choice, a portfolio showing client work (for experienced hires), and a portfolio of your best designs for personal projects (for experienced hires and interns). I believe that client work, especially for big clients, doesn't necessarily reflect what you are capable of because #conservativecorporateculture.  

All engineers: 
- version control (e.g. Git), 
- Continuous Integration/ Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) (e.g. Gitlab CI), 
- Linux, 
- containers (e.g. Docker), container orchestration (e.g. Docker Compose, Docker swarm), 
- writing tests (ideally that run in CI/CD)
- writing and understanding OpenAPI specifications
- Domain knowledge and interest: we work with IoT, networking protocols, the public key infrastructure, cybersecurity, industrial control systems and embedded systems. 
- You don't have to be brilliant, just solid. [Sometimes brilliant programmers (with egos) write code that nobody else can understand or work with, and derail projects.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde/) 

Soft skills for everyone:
- the ability to learn things independently e.g. understand code in other languages we don't normally use, Google intelligently, finding and then [Reading the Fancy Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)
- Learn [How To Ask Questions the Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
- Work with teammates to get help when you're stuck on something for longer than say 30 minutes and have done the above, especially [Reading the Fancy Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)
- Being a person we want to work with. We tend to assess this in a video (or pre-pandemic, a face-to-face) interview. 
- Being flexible. If you stay long enough with us, you will be asked to do things which aren't in your job description. 

### For every one who wants to join us
Obviously, the more points in the above section which you can tick off, the better for you. This is because you are more obviously a less risky hire. 

### Your CV format
I use a shared spreadsheet to track the applicants. So the following is helpful to me:
- Please make it possible to select and copy text from your CV (UI/UX people with beautiful CVs that I must manually transcribe, please take note)
- Check that the copied text does not paste with extra white space and line breaks.
- PDF or Microsoft Word is fine. But engineers where I work use Linux, so your beautifully formatted Word document with proprietary fonts is going to look terrible when I open it in LibreOffice.
- Some PDFs mangle the text into gibberish. This becomes obvious only when you copy and paste the text into other files. Please check that your PDF does not do this. Otherwise I have to manually transcribe things. 
- For technical hires, make it easy to figure out which tools, languages and frameworks you know. Add a link to your Github account and include your personal projects in your CV. This is especially important if your work history does not reflect what you are capable of or match what you are applying for. 


### For the newly-minted Bootcamp graduate
I am including this section because there have been so many people who want to be hired as experienced data scientists after they have spent the past five years working in auditing, financial analysis or fast moving consumer goods, but have done That Four-Month General Assembly Data Science Intensive.

Two years of programming experience and two years of demonstrated experience in data analysis and the like has been my guideline for experienced hires. If you are applying as an intern, then this requirement is relaxed. The more than you can show that you meet the wishlist, the better. 

Career changers, you need to show that you have programming experience beyond that bit of Python you did in that General Assembly Data Science Intensive. Some points:
- Automating Microsoft Office applications with Visual Basic does not count. Linux does not run Microsoft Office. Also "true programmers" laugh in the face of Visual Basic. This is arguably elitism, but I digress. 
- Show what you know. Take part in hackathons or complete challenges on platforms like Leetcode.com. Then set up a Github repository and share what you have done and learned. 
- Show that you can work in a team of programmers. Hackathons are good for this, and thanks to the pandemic it's all virtual these days. Then share the code on GitHub. (Are you noticing a trend yet?)

In terms of career changers, I would say that non-software engineers with domain knowledge and programming experience, or software engineers who are not data scientists are probably at an advantage. This is because they hit more of the wishlist, and are less risky hires. Two recent hires fall into the latter category; one of them had experience working with safety critical software systems, i.e. if the program is wrong, the rocket will crash.

With so many data science applicants, we really are able to pick and choose - see the rocket scientist above. If you would be a brilliant hire, but have not put anything in your CV that makes it easy for us to assess how you fit the wishlist, then we won't even invite you to do a technical assessment, let alone invite you to an interview. Because organising and arranging those things takes me away from my actual job of building things. 

I am a career changer too. I was able to do another degree in computer science, though it was an overseas programme, so it was not the full on-campus experience. The community around makers, programming and cybersecurity in Singapore is amazing, and so are the activities that go with it. I only learned about it after attending too many highly-publicised "tech" events that aren't *cough, cough* actually technical, but are more geared at getting aspiring founders together in a room with people with money. I also started as an intern. Those of you who are used to the salaries in financial services will balk, but I knew that being hired as an intern is less risky for the company and would work in my favour. 

I hope this helps in your job search and best of luck.
