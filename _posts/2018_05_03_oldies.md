### Resurrecting old code

I've been gathering ideas on software architecture recently, and have come across the late Pieter Hintjens' work.

In his "Confessions of a Necromancer", he talked about Libero, a tool to generate code from a description of a state machine.

The source code and docs are up at <https://github.com/imatix-legacy/libero>.

Here's what I did to get it to compile.

You have to remove the EOF characters that were added to DOS files back in the day.
Then get a new version of the prelude.h file from this discussion:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/macs-announcement/V2d8HdCJmRA>

Looking at either prelude.h file is a blast from the past :)

```console
foo@bar:~/Downloads/libero$ sed -i 's/\o32//g' *.c
foo@bar:~/Downloads/libero$ sed -i 's/\o32//g' *.h
foo@bar:~/Downloads/libero$ cc lr.c lr????.c -o lr
```
