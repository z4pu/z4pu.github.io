## Presentation for JuniorDev.SG Code and Tell

Yesterday evening I had the opportunity to give a presentation on things I learned while programming with OpenSSL.

Topics covered included the history of the project, getting the source code, things to keep in mind and watch out for, a (very quick) rundown of the sockets API and network data encapsulation, and how the TLS handshake builds on the TCP handshake.
